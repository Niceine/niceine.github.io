                                <h5>Barbara Livesay, Lead DBA, Enable Midstream Partners</h5>
                                <p>I first met James Gilpin in 2008 while he was working as a contractor for Software AG. James was assigned to help us at CenterPoint Energy migrate our very large complicated Gas Information System from a mainframe to UNIX. James was a great asset for our migration and our team. He was a wonderful fit and we went on to hire him as a full time employee in 2011. Over those ten years, I’ve worked with James in several capacities. First, he was a patient contractor mentoring me, then a fellow team member, always willing and able to dig in and solve any problem, and for the last several years, my supportive boss. James is one of the finest people that I have ever had the pleasure of working with and I’ve been blessed to work with several. He is an honest, hardworking, caring leader and great to work with whether in person or remotely. I think that James’ greatest asset is his broad, detailed knowledge base and his desire to continuously learn new things. He likes digging into how different software products work and finding new practical applications for using them. He has a great memory and a keen interest in extending his knowledge of all things IT related. He came to our company because of his extensive knowledge of Software AG products, but over the years he got involved in so much more. He has the ability to see the ‘bigger picture’ and how to link various products together into a solution. He is also good with people and has excellent project leadership skills. I highly recommend James for any position. He would be an asset to any organization seeking a motivated, hardworking, professional who is capable of dealing with complex concepts and applications and making them fit together and work.</p>

                                <h5>Emmett Oliver, Service Delivery Manager, General Dynamics Information Technology</h5>
                                <p>I have had the privilege of knowing and working with James for over 10 years. James joined our CenterPoint Energy IT department prior to a very critical migration project. The migration project involved moving the business critical Pipeline Gas Management System from an IBM mainframe environment to Unix. James was the IT Manager of Technology Internals and Database Management and for the migration project he was the Project Manager. With James' knowledge, experience and leadership, the migration project was a huge success and helped save the CenterPoint Energy Pipeline Group an estimated million dollars in annual mainframe software licenses and support. James is very knowledgeable and has the corresponding experience in project management, Unix/Linux technical internals, application development and support, and database management and support. James has the experience in Agile, SCRUM, and Waterfall project management methodologies. James designed and created development, test, staging, and production environments for the CenterPoint Energy Pipeline IT Department (and later Enable Midstream IT Department) to effectively develop, maintain, and support C#, Java, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and Software AG Natural/Adabas. I highly recommend James for his dedication, work ethic, knowledge, experience, leadership, coaching and mentoring. James is a respected IT Leader. </p>

                                    James was a great help to me on a number of occasions. He clearly understands the technology tools that are available in the marketplace and is open to the possibility of new ones.
                                    He is a great listener and provides ideas to help others in their work tasks. I am thankful for the opportunity to work with him on this project and hope that we can work together on a future project.

                                    James is an exceptional manager and co-worker that would enhance any software development or architectural team. James likes to prepare himself with as many facts as possible before tackling a problem so that he can weigh options without excessive assumption. James allows his employees to take risks as a way for them to exceed and excel in new areas of expertise, without the fear of disappointment if a concept fails. He is very hands-on and more than willing to help his team as much as needed, but can delegate tasks without ever micromanaging. James excels at communicating with his team, users, and management, and is very respectful but doesn't shy away from the truth.

                                    James is no-nonsense, get it done, project manager. I have known James for many years. He always received outstanding remarks as a instructor for Software AG. I worked extensively with James during a challenging migration project. When James started the project, he spent a significant amount of time, rebuilding the Software AG relationship in the account. Hopefully, James and I will be able to work together on a project again!
